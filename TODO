The Unholy TODO List of the Hellsmith

Populate the sources as specified by Makefile

Turn C# into C++, for architectures that don't have suitable Common Language Runtimes

Cast DirectX's iron grasp into /dev/null for all eternity! (that is accomplished with using a custom variant of GZDoom's GL/Vk abstraction layer)

Design a consistent interface based on GTK

Make a new set of extra icons (assisted by a new tool called scrgut)

Write the documentation (for yelp, GNOME's help viewer and a man page for it's command line switches)
