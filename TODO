The Unholy TODO List of the Hellsmith (for me and the other coders involved in the project)

Populate the sources as specified by Makefile

Turn C# into C++, for architectures that don't have suitable Common Language Runtimes

Cast DirectX's iron grasp into /dev/null for all eternity! (that is accomplished with using a custom variant of GZDoom's GL/Vk abstraction layer, located at `src/vendor/gzdoom`)

Track down dem GLSL shaders from GZDoom

Design a consistent interface based on GTK

Make a new set of extra icons (assisted by a new tool called scrgut)

Write the documentation (for yelp, GNOME's help viewer and a man page for it's command line switches)

Create non-GTK interfaces for the editor. (uses a unique font!)
