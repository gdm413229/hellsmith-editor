# Hellsmith (GTK3)

Hellsmith is an editor for GZDoom archives and maps.  The project is conceived as a Linux counterpart to the Windows-exclusive GZDoom Builder.  The original vision was to be integrated into GZDoom.

## Contributor Code of Conduct

If you contribute to Hellsmith or GZDB-BF, feel free to translate your C++ code to C# and vice versa so you cna contribute to the two projects.

## Rendering Architecture

The GZDoom renderer abstraction layers take the brunt of the rendering workload instead of the Windows-exclusive SlimDX.
